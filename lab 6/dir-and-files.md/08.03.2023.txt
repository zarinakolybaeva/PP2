What is a directory?
 A Directory also sometimes known as a folder is a unit organizational structure
 in a computerâ€™s file system for storing and locating files or more folders. 
 Python now supports a number of APIs to list the directory contents. 
 For instance, we can use the Path.iterdir, os.scandir, os.walk, Path.rglob, or os.listdir .

1->os.listdir() method gets the list of all files and directories in a specified directory. 
 By default, it is the current directory. Beyond the first level of folders, os.listdir() does not return any files or folders.
