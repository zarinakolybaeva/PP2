#Write a program to solve a classic puzzle: We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? create function: solve(numheads, numlegs):
def solve(numheads,numlegs):
    rab=(numlegs-(2*numheads))/2
    chick=numheads-rab
    return rab,chick

numheads=35
numlegs=94
solutions=solve(numheads,numlegs)
print(solutions)
